      <h1>Short Form Case Study: <br/>Search vs Browse</h1>
      <div class="study-summary">
        <p>MindBody is an <strong>app for booking health and fitness classes</strong>...</p>
        <p>...But also haircuts and doctor's appointments.</p>
        <p>I worked in a team of 3 to <strong>identify the real needs of the users</strong>,</p>
        <p>and <strong>streamline the search and results</strong> pages.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="study-specs">
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> We had two weeks to learn choose a feature to improve in the MindBody app, by researching who they were, how and why they used the app, and which needs were not being met.</p>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> February 24 - March 6, 2020</p>
        <p><strong>Who was involved:</strong> Myself and two colleagues</p>
        <p><strong>End product:</strong> A medium-fidelity digital prototype demonstrating all changes, plus all artifacts leading to that prototype</p>
        <p><strong>My primary contribution:</strong> Information Architecture Lead</p>
      </div>

      <h2>The Scenario</h2>
      <h5>User research led us to find that users love the app, but they only use it in the very specific ways that they know how. We wanted to encourage exploration, and the kind of engagement they have with the businesses themselves.</h5>
      <div class="casestudy-p">

        <h3 class="casestudy-h">Browse vs Search</h3>
        <p>There is an often-overlooked but important distinction between <strong>browsing</strong> and <strong>searching</strong>. <strong>Browsing</strong> is a means of discovering what there is to search for - it starts with a base knowledge near zero, and builds ideas for the user until they know what they'd like. <strong>Searching</strong> starts from specific knowledge or needs from the user (they already know what they want), and helps them reduce the possibilities until they can find one like they were looking for.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="images\mindbody\_01a_browse.png" alt="#">
          <figcaption>The "Explore" section of our updated design. Users are given a list of keywords, paired with images, and organized by tab.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="images\mindbody\_01b_search.png" alt="#">
          <figcaption>The "Search" section of our updated design. The user is prompted to "Start Typing" - this is great if they know what to type, but if not, better go to "Explore" and find out what's even possible!</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Originally, Mindbody blurred the lines between these two approaches - in fact, the Wellness and Beauty tabs on the results pages even <strong>redirected to the "Explore" categories</strong>, rather than to the search results for the term searched for. This was such a jarring and obvious bug, that it showed how infrequently the tabs as they are currently configured are even used.</p>

          <img src="images\mindbody\_02a_broken-search.png" alt="#">
          <figcaption>The "Search Results" section of the old design. The tabs don't behave correctly, leading users to ere away from exploring results.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3 class="casestudy-h">Organizing Search Results</h3>
        <p>class/business/staff, vs fitness/wellness/beauty</p>
        
        <figure>
          <img src="#" alt="#">
          <figcaption>before, with bad date design and bad tab design</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="#" alt="#">
          <figcaption>after, with all the beautiful fixes</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p>Key Takeaways</p>
        <div class="casestudy-bigli">
          <h4 class="casestudy-h">Autocomplete</h4>
          <p>Autocomplete suggestions often indicate the category of the suggested result, while still on the search screen</p>
          <h4 class="casestudy-h">Browsing vs Searching</h4>
          <p>Browsing (vs searching) is often given its own space (usually filling the home screen with suggested searches and categories), though browsing wasn’t always emphasized compared to Search</p>
          <h4 class="casestudy-h">Filters</h4>
          <p>Filters appear either on the results screen, or on the search screen itself</p>
          <h4 class="casestudy-h">Categories as primary objects of the app</h4>
          <p>Different categories mean different primary objects in our app - if AirBnB adds “experiences” as a category, it also needs an experiences landing page, an experience “card” for displaying results, etc. Without this cohesion, the categories feel “tacked on”.</p>

      The Problem, and The Solution
      Self-Care Focused MindBody app users need a more efficient way to search activities, businesses, and staff, because current results don’t reflect what users are actually searching for.
      
      Broken filters and confusing results categories (Fitness, Wellness, and Beauty) force the user to search multiple times to find what they’re really looking for.
      
      By separating out the results page into 3 categories (Session, Business, and adding Staff), we will be able to better display results that are useful for the user.
      
      How do users actually want their results displayed? Our research shows that their past activities (their history, their favorites), and their preference for certain staff (which cannot be searched on at the moment) are the driving factors when Searching on the app.


      The best solution is often not a single solution at all, but rather the correct balance and layout of all the most commonly expected solutions. Search may be the most efficient way to find a session, staff, or business, but it’s not the primary way everyone would think to do so. Not unlike Desire Paths, those worn-down trails through a public grassy area where pedestrians have constantly walked in the absence of an intentional paved lane, it’s often best to find the major ways folks would first try to do something, and add a design solution there.
    Additional thoughts:
    Not all design problems come with complaints. Many users loved the app DESPITE search flaws, and often overlooked them completely because of it. That doesn’t mean they can’t be improved, that the user won’t notice when it has been improved.
    Don’t try to reinvent the wheel. But iterating on the wheel, by borrowing its best implementations elsewhere and applying them smartly to your own design problem, that’s much more helpful.
